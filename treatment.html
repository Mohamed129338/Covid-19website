          <p>
            After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:
            <br>
Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test.
<br>
Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.
<br>
If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.
<br>
While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.
<br>
Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.
<br>
Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.
<br>
Clean your hands frequently.
<br>
Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
<br>
Keep the room well-ventilated.
<br>
If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.
<br>
Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.
<br>
Call your health care provider immediately if you have any of these danger signs: difficulty breathing, loss of speech or mobility, confusion or chest pain.
<br>
Stay positive by keeping in touch with people by phone or online, and by exercising at home.

<h1>  Treatment </h1>

<p>Mild/moderate symptoms (80%)
<br>
  Outpatient management of symptoms and isolation
<br>
  OTC Tylenol, cough and cold medications
<br>
  Avoid steroids (ICS or oral/IM) unless compelling need (COPD or Asthma Exac)
<br>
  Possibly avoid ACEI or Ibuprofen – data unclear! 
<br>
  Need to protect family members! (Check CDC guidelines)
<br>
  At least 2 weeks isolation?
<br>
  Unclear when viral shedding no longer present. 
  <br>
  Unclear if we will require two negative tests and/or begin testing IgM IgG

  
  </p>
<br>
  <br>
  <p>Moderate with risks/severe/critical symptoms (15-20%)
     <br>
    Inpatient management and supportive care  
<br>
    Obtain Advanced Directives!  Offer Chaplain Support for high risk patients.
<br>
    Oxygen by NC (place surgical face mask over NC to reduce aerosolization?)
<br>
    Anticipate rapid progression to High Flow/NRB
<br>
    Avoid NIV/BiPAP/Bronchoscopy if possible (increased aerosolization -> risk to others!)
<br>
    ARDS: Controlled early intubation with airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), Paralysis, Prone positioning, Flolan. Tight connections of ETT and tubing. 
    <br>
    Avoid fluid blousing, sepsis protocol bolusing.  NG tube for feeds (ARDS takes time to resolve)
    <br>
    Daily labs: Renal, Mag, CBC with diff, DIC labs, ?LFTs, ?ABG (permissive hypercapnia if needed)
    </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>
      <br> Moderate with risks/severe/critical symptoms (15-20%)  
      <br> BiPAP increases risk of areolation due to positive pressure (as would CPAP), AND generally patients needing BiPAP end up needing intubation.   
        <br> Patients do worse on BiPAP compared to HFNC/NRB.
        <br>  If BiPAP is the ONLY option (no vents) or is needed due to COPD, negative pressure room, air filtration, helmet interface. 
      
     </p>
<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>Moderate with risks/severe/critical symptoms (15-20%)
      <br>Antibiotics, Antifungal probably not helpful (RARE secondary infections)
      <br>Procal and cultures can guide – discontinue at 48 hours
      <br>Watch for HAP/VAP
      <br>Steroid could:	1. increase viral levels, shedding time, lung damage -> ? increase mortality	2. reduce pathological hyper-immune response (beneficial for ARDS)
      <br>At least NOT high dose pulsed steroids (not Solumedrol or Hydrocortisone)
    <br> Cardiac: Watch for late onset cardiomyopathy (? Viral myocarditis) with sudden EF less than 10% leading to cardiogenic shock
      <br>Be careful if coding patients – high risk to you, low chance of survival
